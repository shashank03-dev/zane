## 3. Architecture

ZANE follows a layered architecture for maintainability and extension safety:

- Interface Layer: CLI and terminal dashboard
- Orchestration Layer: pipeline and agent coordination
- Intelligence Layer: models, predictors, evaluators, optimizers
- Science Layer: docking, molecular dynamics, retrosynthesis
- Data Layer: collection, featurization, datasets
- Platform Layer: tests, linting, CI/CD, packaging

### Runtime Flow

1. Collect and merge molecular inputs.
2. Build train/test datasets.
3. Train selected model architecture.
4. Evaluate model behavior and prediction quality.
5. Score and rank candidate molecules.
6. Monitor via dashboard and export artifacts.

## 5. Installation

### Standard Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Recommended Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Optional GPU Validation

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

## 6. Quick Start

### Train a Baseline Model

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli train --model transformer --epochs 20 --batch-size 32
```

### Run Property Prediction

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli predict "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O" \
  --model gnn \
  --checkpoint ./checkpoints/gnn_model.pt
```

### Run ADMET Check

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli admet "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"
```

## 7. Operations Guide

### Data Collection

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli collect --sources pubchem chembl --limit 500
```

### Dashboard (Static)

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli dashboard --static
```

### Dashboard (Live)

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli dashboard --refresh 1.0 --iterations 60
```

### Operational Notes

- Keep checkpoints versioned by experiment intent.
- Use consistent splits for model-to-model comparisons.
- Persist run outputs under dedicated artifact directories.

## 8. AI Support (Meta Llama)

### Basic Command

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli assist "Summarize risk factors in the current candidate shortlist"
```

### Advanced Command with Context

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli assist "Draft next assay plan" \
  --model-id meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct \
  --context "Top candidates: Caffeine, Warfarin" \
  --max-new-tokens 300 \
  --temperature 0.7 \
  --top-p 0.9
```

### Access Requirements

- Meta Llama checkpoints may be gated.
- Ensure model access is approved in your Hugging Face account.
- Provide an auth token in environment variables (for example, HF_TOKEN).

## 9. Dashboard Operations

The terminal dashboard is optimized for operator awareness during active runs.

Displayed signal groups:

- Run metadata and model mode
- KPI panel (throughput, hit rate, quality metrics)
- Training monitor (epoch and loss behavior)
- Candidate queue preview
- Alerts and operational status

## 10. Workflow Blueprints

### Baseline Discovery Workflow

1. Collect 200 to 1000 molecules.
2. Train a transformer baseline.
3. Evaluate and shortlist by quality metrics.
4. Run ADMET checks on the shortlist.
5. Review status in dashboard and export outputs.

### Comparative Workflow

1. Train GNN and transformer with aligned splits.
2. Compare metrics and top-k overlap.
3. Use ensemble mode for consensus ranking.

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

1. Export top candidates.
2. Use AI support to draft test priorities.
3. Finalize shortlist with domain experts.

## 11. Quality and CI/CD

Recommended pre-push checks:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python -m ruff check .
python -m black --check .
```

Expected quality posture:

- Tests must pass for core modules.
- Lint and format checks should be clean.
- User-facing behavior changes should be documented.

## 12. Security and Responsible Use

This repository is intended for research and decision support.

- Do not treat outputs as direct clinical recommendations.
- Validate predictions experimentally.
- Apply governance and provenance controls for data and results.
- Ensure expert review before any high-impact downstream use.

## 13. Troubleshooting

### Llama Model Fails to Load

Potential causes:

- Missing or invalid Hugging Face token
- Access not granted for selected model
- Restricted network environment

### Training Instability

Actions:

- Lower learning rate
- Reduce batch size
- Inspect data quality and target distributions

### CLI Runtime Errors

Actions:

- Confirm virtual environment activation
- Reinstall dependencies
- Re-run with explicit model/checkpoint arguments

## 14. Contribution Standards

Recommended development flow:

1. Create a focused branch.
2. Implement minimal, scoped changes.
3. Run tests and static checks locally.
4. Update documentation for behavior changes.
5. Open PR with validation evidence.
