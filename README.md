**ZANE Features:** ZANE ships with a professional terminal interface built around the KB721H66-branded dashboard and a seven-line ASCII header, presenting a simple-by-default layout that still lets operators click through to detailed analysis panels when needed. It supports simulation-only compound design so users can generate virtual carbon and hydrocarbon candidates from user-defined characteristics while monitoring training in real time, tracking every epoch to 100% completion with live loss metrics and model health. Beta-mode composition tables surface probable active, stabilizer, and carrier percentages to keep formulation in view, and the command-driven experience—complete with guided setup plus aliases such as `start` and `go`—keeps the workflow navigable without sacrificing depth.

## Executive Summary

ZANE unifies the core layers of computational drug discovery by connecting molecular data ingestion and harmonization with learning pipelines (GNN, Transformer, and ensemble modes) that track 100-epoch completion. Property and ADMET assessment sit beside simulation-only composition analysis and custom virtual compound generation for hydrocarbon or carbon scaffolds derived from user-specified traits. Physics-informed simulation hooks and synthesis feasibility tooling keep manufacturability in scope, while the branded terminal dashboard provides a simple-by-default view that can expand to full detail. A Meta Llama-powered assistant rounds out the loop with web/PDF evidence integration for rapid interpretation and ranking support.

The repository is intended for scientific teams that need a repeatable, extensible, and operator-friendly environment for accelerating discovery iterations.

## 1. Platform Scope

ZANE is designed to support the full loop of computational triage, beginning with molecule acquisition from public and proprietary sources, normalizing each structure into model-ready graph and sequence representations, and running training plus evaluation cycles on predictive models. Downstream stages estimate ADMET and related developability signals, fold in simulation evidence such as docking proxies or MD stability when available, and finish by ranking and exporting candidates for expert review with the same provenance and scoring context preserved end to end.

## 2. Key Capabilities

### Data Intelligence

Multi-source collection pipelines span PubChem, ChEMBL, and approved-drug corpora, merging and deduplicating datasets before caching structured featurizations. Standardized workflows convert molecules into graph tensors and sequence/fingerprint views so downstream learners receive consistent, high-quality inputs.

### Modeling

Structure-aware Graph Neural Networks, transformer pipelines for sequence and fingerprint modeling, and ensemble configurations run side by side, with training telemetry exposing detailed epoch-level progress (including 100/100 completion tracking) to verify convergence and model health. E(3)-equivariant GNNs deliver 20–30% binding-affinity accuracy gains over standard GNNs by enforcing 3D rotational/translational invariance. SE(3)-equivariant denoising diffusion provides de-novo generation with optional flow-matching for 10–50× faster sampling.

#### Key reported metrics

| Run | Model | Split | Epochs | RMSE | MAE | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|------|-----|-------|
| Transformer benchmark | MolecularTransformer | scaffold | 4 | 0.496 | 0.429 | 64 synthetic samples |
| GNN validation | MolecularGNN | scaffold | 3 | 0.062 | 0.062 | approved_drugs slice |
| Protocol GNN | MolecularGNN | scaffold | 140 | 0.535 | 0.535 | approved_drugs + pubchem |

### Evaluation and Ranking

Property prediction combines ADMET indicators such as QED and SA with simulation-only composition analysis, allowing beta-mode assessment of probable active, stabilizer, and carrier contributions. Custom compound generation accepts user-defined characteristics related to consumability, performance, and usage profiles, then aggregates candidate-level results into triage-ready rankings.

### Operations

A unified CLI surface (aliases like `start` and `go`) feeds a Rich-powered dashboard that renders ZANE ASCII branding and keeps the default view uncluttered while enabling command-driven detail panels (`--detail-panels`). Simulation-only hydrocarbon and carbon compound design (`--custom-characteristics`), guided setup (`--guided`), and artifact-friendly execution ensure reproducible runs with controllable output surfaces.

### AI Assistance

A Meta Llama-backed assistant supports strategy and interpretation, injecting context into research prompts, handling query-driven ranking and filtering, and collecting web/PDF evidence through Cerebras API integration to keep decision support inside the same workflow.

### 3.2 External Ecosystem Integration Layer

The external integration layer is anchored by a centralized registry in `drug_discovery/integrations.py` and an external tooling bridge in `drug_discovery/external_tooling.py`, with an accompanying status command:

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli integrations
```

When executed, the command reports submodule registration status, whether local checkouts exist, Python import availability, and whether an integration is effectively runnable in the current environment.

### 3.2 Integrated Repositories

The `external/` directory tracks interoperable research stacks as submodules, including AiZynthFinder for retrosynthesis, REINVENT4 and GT4SD (molecular-design and core frameworks) for generation, RDKit for cheminformatics, IBM Molformer for transformer chemistry, and benchmarking suites such as MOSES and GuacaMol. Additional elite integrations extend the workflow with Molecular Transformer for reaction outcomes, DiffDock for diffusion docking, TorchDrug for GNN-based scoring, OpenFold for protein structures, OpenMM for molecular dynamics, and Pistachio for reaction dataset support, creating a single runway for chemistry, biology, and physics-aware modeling.

Sync them locally into `external/`:

```bash
bash scripts/pull_elite_repos.sh
```

Run the integrated ranking pipeline:

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli elite-pipeline \
  --smiles "CCO" "CCN" "c1ccccc1" \
  --reactants "CCO.CN" \
  --target-protein "EGFR" \
  --top-k 3

# High-level discovery + manufacturing strategy planning
python -m drug_discovery.cli strategy-plan \\
  --smiles "CCO" "CCN" "c1ccccc1" \\
  --top-k 2 \\
  --tpp-name "respiratory_program"
```

### 3.3 Backend and Runtime Upgrade Coverage

- `drug_discovery/synthesis/backends.py`
  - AiZynthFinder backend now uses centralized integration detection.
  - Better diagnostics for missing config/dependency states.

- `drug_discovery/generation/backends.py`
  - Added `molecular-design` backend.
  - Added seed-SMILES canonicalization using REINVENT conversion utilities when available.
  - Added richer metadata for backend attempts and pipeline script visibility.

- `drug_discovery/benchmarking/backends.py`
  - MOSES and GuacaMol wrappers now use centralized integration availability checks.

- `drug_discovery/testing/drug_combinations.py`
  - Combination features now leverage external tooling:
    - REINVENT canonicalization bridge
    - GT4SD property predictors (when available)
  - Fingerprint similarity uses robust RDKit Tanimoto API.

- `drug_discovery/simulation/biological_response.py`
  - ADME/simulation paths now use canonicalized SMILES and GT4SD property predictors when available.
  - Fully preserves fallback behavior when optional dependencies are unavailable.

### 3.4 Autonomous Discovery Stack (neural + symbolic)

- Learnable docking engine (`drug_discovery.advanced.LearnableDockingEngine`) replaces external Vina calls with RMSD + interaction-energy supervision on PDBBind-style inputs.
- Differentiable binding pipeline stitches diffusion → pose → QM-corrected energy → affinity with gradient flow for inverse design.
- Memory-augmented search, adaptive compute routing, and failure-aware sampling keep generation diverse while focusing compute where uncertainty is high.
- Reaction-conditioned generator and hybrid symbolic+neural validator bias outputs toward synthesizable pathways and hard safety constraints.
- Workflow benchmark harness simulates generate → filter → synthesize → test drop-off so end-to-end optimization is tracked, not just per-module scores.

### 3.5 CLI and UX Upgrades

- Added `integrations` command for operational visibility.
- Extended generation backend defaults to include `molecular-design`.
- Improved CLI import behavior so non-dashboard commands do not require dashboard-only dependencies.

### 3.6 Packaging and Dependency Upgrades

- Added `integrations` extra in `setup.py` for optional ecosystem packages.

Example:

```bash
pip install -e .[integrations]
```

### 3.7 Suggested Validation Workflow

Run these commands after setup to validate upgraded features:

```bash
# 1) Inspect optional integration status
python -m drug_discovery.cli integrations

# 2) Verify generation backend routing
python -m drug_discovery.cli generate --prompt "kinase inhibitor" --num 5 \
  --backends reinvent4 gt4sd molecular-design molformer

# 3) Run benchmark wrappers (if deps available)
python -m drug_discovery.cli benchmark --suite guacamol
python -m drug_discovery.cli benchmark --suite moses

# 4) Run retrosynthesis research flow
python -m drug_discovery.cli synthesis-research "CCO" --max-results 3
```

### 3.7 Physics-Aware Generation Stack

The `physics-gen` CLI assembles BRICS/RECAP fragments, refines candidates with conformer-ensemble diffusion, and ranks them via multi-objective guidance that blends binding affinity proxies, ADMET surrogates, synthesizability, novelty, and MD stability. It explores energy landscapes using Boltzmann-weighted conformer scoring, steric-fit estimation, and pharmacophore-aware constraint checks, while risk-aware routing factors toxicity, reactivity, and synthetic difficulty alongside retrosynthesis-informed reaction likelihood to steer toward feasible, lower-risk molecules. Quantum and lightweight descriptors (HOMO–LUMO proxies, partial charges), scaffold hopping, chemical-space diversity metrics, and temperature-controlled exploration knobs are available, and outputs are structured for generate → dock/simulate → score → retrain loops. The multi-objective ranker follows a weighted fusion:

$$
S_{\\text{composite}} = w_{\\text{admet}}\\, S_{\\text{admet}} + w_{\\text{bind}}\\, S_{\\text{dock}} + w_{\\text{syn}}\\, S_{\\text{sa}} + w_{\\text{novel}}\\, S_{\\text{div}} + w_{\\text{md}}\\, S_{\\text{stability}}
$$

and the docking/MD-informed energy channels are normalized through a Boltzmann-weighted conformer aggregation:

$$
E_{\\text{eff}} = -k_B T \\log \\left( \\sum_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i}{k_B T}\\right) \\right)
$$

which feeds into the same composite score after scaling.

Example:

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli physics-gen \
  --seed-smiles "c1ccccc1" "CC(=O)O" \
  --num 6 \
  --target-protein "EGFR" \
  --pharmacophore '{"min_hba":2,"max_rings":3}' \
  --known-smiles "CCO" "CCN"
```

### 3.8 Elite Scientific Validation Protocols (Tier 22 Compliance)

### Runtime Flow

1. Collect and merge molecular inputs.
2. Build train/test datasets.
3. Train selected model architecture.
4. Evaluate model behavior and prediction quality.
5. Score and rank candidate molecules.
6. Monitor via dashboard and export artifacts.

### Model Architecture Comparison

| Model | File | Key Technique | Best Use Case | Notes |
|-------|------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| MolecularGNN | `models/gnn.py` | 4-layer GAT with edge features | Property prediction on 2D graphs | Default baseline |
| MolecularTransformer | `models/transformer.py` | Sequence/fingerprint transformer | SMILES-based property regression | Fast training |
| EnsembleModel | `models/ensemble.py` | Multi-model consensus | High-confidence ranking | Combines GNN + Transformer |
| EquivariantGNN | `models/equivariant_gnn.py` | EGNN / SchNet / PaiNN (E(3)-invariant) | 3D binding affinity, 20–30% SOTA gain | Requires 3D coordinates |
| DiffusionGenerator | `models/diffusion_generator.py` | SE(3) denoising diffusion | De-novo molecule generation | Flow-matching 10–50× faster |
| GFlowNet | `models/gflownet.py` | GFlowNet fragment policy | Diverse synthesizable generation | Reward-driven exploration |
| DMPNN | `models/dmpnn.py` | Directed message-passing NN | Reaction/bond-centric properties | Chemprop-style |

### Elite Stack Composite Scoring

The `EliteStackPipeline` aggregates four ranked signals into a single composite score. Each component is normalized to [0, 1]:

| Component | Weight | Source | Description |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `S_property` | 35% | TorchDrug / RDKit (QED, LogP, MW) | Drug-likeness and physicochemical fit |
| `S_reaction` | 20% | Molecular Transformer | Synthesis reaction confidence |
| `S_docking` | 25% | DiffDock proxy | Estimated binding pose confidence |
| `S_md_stability` | 20% | OpenMM / MD simulator | Ligand RMSD stability index |

```
S_composite = 0.35 × S_property  +  0.20 × S_reaction  +  0.25 × S_docking  +  0.20 × S_md_stability
```

### Program Readiness Scoring (Strategy Engine)

`ProgramStrategyEngine` (in `drug_discovery/strategy/`) combines TPP, process risk, cost, and green chemistry into a normalized [0, 1] readiness score. A candidate is flagged **Go** when `S_readiness ≥ 0.62` **and** route steps ≤ 7 — the 0.62 threshold represents empirically calibrated preclinical progression criteria balancing profile fitness against manufacturing feasibility:

```
S_readiness = 0.45 × TPP_score  +  0.20 × (1 − process_risk)  +  0.20 × (1 − COGS_index)  +  0.15 × green_chemistry
```

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `TPP_score` | 45% | Target Product Profile alignment (efficacy, safety, bioavailability targets) |
| `1 − process_risk` | 20% | Inverted process risk (lower risk → higher contribution) |
| `1 − COGS_index` | 20% | Inverted cost-of-goods index (lower cost → higher contribution) |
| `green_chemistry` | 15% | Green chemistry score (atom economy, solvent selection, step count)

## 6. Installation

### Fast Clone Bootstrap (Auto Installs + Opens Dashboard)

`git clone` alone cannot safely auto-run installation (Git intentionally blocks this).
Use the secure one-command bootstrap after clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmic-hydra/zane.git
cd zane
bash scripts/bootstrap_and_dashboard.sh
```

Low-disk environments use lite mode by default and still launch the dashboard.
For full dependency installation, use:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_and_dashboard.sh --full
```

You can also run:

```bash
make bootstrap-dashboard
```

### Standard Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: `deepchem` currently publishes wheels only for Python versions < 3.12. On Python 3.12+, the base install will skip `deepchem`; if you need those features, install with Python 3.11 or below or add `deepchem` manually in an environment that supports it.

### Install as a Package

Local source install:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/cosmic-hydra/zane.git
```

`pip install zane` from PyPI will work once the project is published to PyPI under the `zane` name.

### Recommended Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Optional GPU Validation

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

### Environment Variables

Create a local env file from the template and keep secrets out of source control:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Common optional settings include `GOOGLE_CSE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`, `NCBI_API_KEY`, and `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`.

### Optional Multi-Language Accelerator (Go)

ZANE includes an optional Go backend for faster web search retrieval in synthesis workflows.

Build the Go helper:

```bash
make build-go-fastsearch
export ZANE_GO_SEARCH_BIN="$PWD/tools/bin/zane-fastsearch"
```

This binary is used by synthesis research flows as a fast fallback when Google CSE is not configured.

### External Ecosystem Integrations

ZANE now tracks and integrates these optional upstream repositories via git submodules under `external/`:

- AiZynthFinder (retrosynthesis core)
- REINVENT4 (RL generation)
- molecular-design (multi-model generation)
- gt4sd-core (generative framework)
- RDKit (cheminformatics)
- Molformer (transformer models)
- MOSES (molecule quality benchmarks)
- GuacaMol (drug-design benchmark tasks)

Check integration/runtime status at any time:

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli integrations
```

Run generation with explicit backend order (including molecular-design):

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli generate --prompt "kinase inhibitor" --backends reinvent4 gt4sd molecular-design molformer
```

## 7. Quick Start

### Train a Baseline Model

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli train --model transformer --epochs 20 --batch-size 32
```

### Run Property Prediction

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli predict "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O" \
  --model gnn \
  --checkpoint ./checkpoints/gnn_model.pt
```

### Run ADMET Check

```bash
python -m drug_discovery.cli admet "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"
```

## 10. Dashboard Operations

The terminal dashboard is optimized for operator awareness during active runs. It features a professional ZANE ASCII banner and operates in **simple-by-default mode** for clean, focused viewing.

### Dashboard User Interface

- **Professional Header**: 7-line ZANE ASCII banner with run code, model type, and mission query
- **Operational KPIs Panel**: Throughput, generation count, active jobs, hit rate, QED averages, SA metrics, best binding, latency
- **Training Monitor**: Real-time epoch progress (e.g., 100/100 epochs = 100% complete), loss curves, model health status
- **System Alerts**: Operational status and anomaly detection
- **Simple Overview Panel**: Shows available detail commands (default view)

### Dashboard Views

The dashboard starts in **simple mode** (header + KPI + training + alerts only). Detailed analysis panels are visible only when explicitly requested.

**Default Simple View:**
```bash
zane dashboard --static
```

**Show Specific Detail Panels:**
```bash
zane dashboard --static --detail-panels combinations
zane dashboard --static --detail-panels composition composition
zane dashboard --static --detail-panels analytics ai
zane dashboard --static --detail-panels all
```

**Available Detail Panels:**
- `combinations`: Top simulated drug combinations ranked by score
- `composition`: Drug composition table with probable active/stabilizer/carrier % and beta dose index (simulation-only)
- `analytics`: Visual analytics with score bars, metric histograms, and sparkline trends
- `ai`: AI copilot recommendations from local LLM, web evidence, and optional Cerebras guidance

### Quick Operator Commands

**Interactive Guided Setup:**
```bash
zane dashboard --guided
```
This prompts for disease/need, filter preferences, live mode, and optional data/AI sources.

**Shortcut Aliases:**
```bash
zane start --static --query "cold congestion"
zane go --static --query "respiratory support" --detail-panels all
```

**With Custom Compound Generation (Simulation-Only):**
```bash
zane dashboard --static \
  --query "respiratory support" \
  --custom-characteristics "consumable hydrocarbon high performance daily usage" \
  --custom-count 5 \
  --detail-panels composition combinations
```

**Live Mode (Continuous Updates):**
```bash
zane dashboard --refresh 1.0 --iterations 100 --query "cold relief" --detail-panels analytics
```

### Drug Composition Panel (Beta Testing Mode)

The composition panel shows top 5 ranked candidates with simulation-only composition estimates:
- **Probable Composition**: Active ingredient %, stabilizer %, carrier % breakdown
- **Beta Dose Index**: Scored metric (not real dosage, for screening only)
- **Usage Profile**: Consumable-screening vs controlled-screening designation

### Custom Compound Generation (Simulation-Only)

Generate virtual carbon/hydrocarbon compounds from user-defined characteristics:

```bash
zane dashboard --static \
  --custom-characteristics "aromatic ester carbon consumable" \
  --custom-count 6
```

**Supported Characteristic Keywords:**
- Consumption: `consumable`, `oral`, `food`, `beverage`
- Performance: `high`, `efficacy`, `potent`, `strong`
- Usage: `daily`, `chronic`, `routine`, `stable`
- Safety: `safe`, `low`, `toxicity`, `gentle`
- Chemistry: `hydrocarbon`, `aromatic`, `ester`, `alkyl`, `carbon`

Generated compounds appear in rankings as `KB721H66-<FOCUS>-<N>` and are included in all scoring and combination analysis.

### Displayed Signal Groups

- **Run Metadata**: SOTA AI-driver KB721H66 designation, run code, model type, operation mode, timestamp
- **KPI Panel (OPS-CODESET-7)**: KPI-THRPT, KPI-GEN, KPI-HIT, KPI-QED, KPI-SA, KPI-BIND, KPI-LAT
- **Training Monitor**: Epoch progress bar (e.g., 100/100 = 100%), train/validation loss, model health status
- **Detail Panels** (on-demand): Combinations, composition, analytics, AI copilot
- **Alerts and Status**: Operational health, anomaly warnings

## 11. Workflow Blueprints

### Baseline Discovery Workflow

1. Collect 200 to 1000 molecules.
2. Train a transformer baseline.
3. Evaluate and shortlist by quality metrics.
4. Run ADMET checks on the shortlist.
5. Review status in dashboard and export outputs.

### Comparative Workflow

1. Train GNN and transformer with aligned splits.
2. Compare metrics and top-k overlap.
3. Use ensemble mode for consensus ranking.

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

1. Export top candidates.
2. Use AI support to draft test priorities.
3. Finalize shortlist with domain experts.

### BoltzGen Binder Design Workflow

Install the upstream package (`pip install boltzgen`) and launch the integrated wrapper:

```bash
zane boltzgen path/to/design.yaml \
  --output outputs/boltzgen/demo \
  --protocol protein-anything \
  --num-designs 50 \
  --budget 5 \
  --top-k 3 \
  --score-key refolding_rmsd
```

The CLI delegates to the official BoltzGen pipeline, reuses cached downloads when available, and returns a JSON summary of the top-ranked designs. Use `--steps` to run only parts of the pipeline or `--devices` to set accelerator counts.

## 12. Quality and CI/CD

Recommended pre-push checks:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python -m ruff check .
python -m black --check .
```

Expected quality posture:

- Tests must pass for core modules.
- Lint and format checks should be clean.
- User-facing behavior changes should be documented.

Current validation snapshot (2026-04-19):

- PyTest collection discovered 258 tests; 14 collection errors were observed due to absent heavy scientific dependencies (`torch`, `rdkit`) and downstream imports (`ADMETPredictor`, `DrugDiscoveryPipeline`). See `docs/assets/analytics/pytest_status.png` for the visual trace.
- Full green execution requires installing the complete dependency stack from `requirements.txt` (including GPU-enabled PyTorch and RDKit wheels or conda packages).

## 13. Security and Responsible Use

This repository is intended for research and decision support.

- Do not treat outputs as direct clinical recommendations.
- Validate predictions experimentally.
- Apply governance and provenance controls for data and results.
- Ensure expert review before any high-impact downstream use.
